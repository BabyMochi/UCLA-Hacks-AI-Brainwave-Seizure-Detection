        <h1>EEG of Brainwaves for Seizure Detection</h1>

        <div class = "description">
            <p>
                The Electroencephalography (EEG) software that detects electrical activity of the convoluted neural network of the brainwaves. Through Machine
                Learning (ML) we implemented a program that reads the electrical movement of the neurons. Such movements can lead to seizures.
                Seizures by definition involve sudden, temporary, bursts of electrical activity in the brain that change or disrupt the way
                messages are sent between brain cells. With this understanding of movements the EEG will detect abnormalities in brain waves.
                
                On the other hand, the EEG is also used to evaluate epilepsy is a neurological disease that differs from seizures. People who
                have epilepsy have lower seizure threshold, this means they are more likely to have seizures than people without epilepsy.
                Seizure is classified as an event and can be a symptom of other medical problems.
